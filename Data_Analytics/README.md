# Data Analytics Portfolio

This section highlights my ** Data Analytics Projects**, where I extract insights from data using SQL, Python, and visualizstion tools. Projects simulate on the job analysis workflows, from cleaning messy datasets to building interactive dashboards. 


## Projects
- **SQL Projects** ---> Complex queries to analyze sales, customer behavior, and operational performance. Includes ER diagrams for relational data design.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ---> Python based analysis of real world datasets (maternal health, aircraft maintenance), with visualizations highlighting patterns and trends.
- **Dashboard (Power BI/ Tableau / Matplotlib)**---> Visual dashboards providing business insights into sales, revenue, and KPIs.


## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & transformation (pandas, Python)
- SQL queries, joins, and aggregations
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI)
- Business intelligence & storytelling with data
- Statistical analysis & reporting
