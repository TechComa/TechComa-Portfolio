This section highlights my skills in **Software Quality Assurance** through manual testing, automation, and API validation. Projects here simulate real world QA workflows such as test planning, defect reporting, and automated regression testing.

## Projects
- **Manual Test Plans** ---> Designed structured test plans, executed test cases, and defects.
- **Selenium Automation** ---> Automated end to end test scenerios using Selenium WebDriver with Python.
- **API Testing (Postman)** ---> Created and executed API test collections to validate endpoints, verify data consistency, and test error handling.


## Skills Demonstrated

- Defect Reporting & Documentation
- Regression Testing (Manual  & Automated)
- Selenium WebDriver (Python/Java)
- API Testing with Postman
